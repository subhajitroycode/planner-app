# Calculator Widget

The planner app has a calculator widget. The file name of my widget is CalculatorWidget and also I've added another component file here is the file path `src/components/Button.js` 

### Here is some appropriate reasons to have a calculator widget in a planner app:

- It allows users to perform simple calculations without leaving the app.
  
- The calculator widget enables users to input and manipulate numerical data, facilitating accurate and efficient planning. With this tool readily available, planners can make informed decisions and stay on top of their tasks with ease.
  
- The calculator widget eliminates the need for manual calculations, reducing the risk of human error. With its built-in algorithms, the widget ensures precise calculations and eliminates common mistakes, such as transposition errors or miscalculations.

- By integrating a calculator widget in the planner app, users can perform calculations seamlessly without switching between applications. This saves time and effort, enabling users to stay focused on their tasks within the centralized hub of the app.
  
- It is a useful tool that enhances the functionality and convenience of the planner app.

 The calculator widget serves as a valuable addition to any planner app, catering to a wide range of planning scenarios and empowering users to accomplish their tasks effectively.
